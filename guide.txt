A Guide to the Jikno.com user API:

	Basic Syntax:
	https://www.jikno.com/api/api.php?key=<your_api_key>&action=<action>

	<your_api_key> is required.  You can email me at jikno@gmail.com to get a key.

	<action> = one of the following:
		* create_user - params: password, email, content (optional).
			* Action: Creates a new user.
			* Return type: string.

		* validate_user - params: password, email.
			* Action: Checks if the the sent credintials match.
			* Return value: JSON array containg one value, a boolean.

		* get_user_info - params: username, password.
			* Action: Gets the user's information object -> user_info branch (see information object below).
			* Return value: JSON object.
		
		* set_user_info = params: username, password, content.
			* Action: Sets the user_info branch.
			* Return value: none.

		* sub_content - params: content, branch_name***, username, password.
			* Action: Replace the existing information object -> user_info branch with the one sent up in the content paramater.
			* Return value: JSON object.
            		*** If the branch does not exixt, it will be created.

		* get_content - params: branch_name, username, password.
			* Action: Replace the existing content of the branch listed in the information object with the values sent up in the content paramater.
			* Return value: none.

	Params:
		All params besides the two in the url above must be sent as post headers.

	Information Object:
		Here is a sample:
			{
				default_values: {
					username: "BobJacker" //Optional
					name: "Bob", //Optional
					age: "34" //Optional
				},
				//Additional branches can be added: Example:
				done_to_do_list: {
					//Information in that branch.
				}
			}

		The manager at manager.jikno.com has it's own branch, the to do list it's own, and so on.

	Errors:
		If there is an error in the params, or for some reason the server cannot conplete the given task, it will return a JSON object similar to this:
		'{"error":true,"message":"This is what happened...","code":"<error_code>"}'

        <error_code> will be one of the following:
            * INVALID_BRANCH : This is returned on the "get_content" action, where the branch that you are trying to get from does not exist.
			* ACCOUNT_EXISTS : This is returned on the "create_user" action, when the user that is being created already exists.
			* OK : This code is returned on the "create_user" and "validate_user" branches when everything is fine.
            * INVALID_PARAMS : This is returned on the "create_user" and "validate_user" branches when the params are not valid.
            * FAILED : This code is returned when an unknown error occurs on any action.  See the data tree of the response fro more info.
            * INVALID_USER : This is returned on the "validate_user" action where the requested username and password do not match.
